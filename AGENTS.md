REPO GUIDELINES
- This is a repository with variable unrelated projects. Each folder in main directory constitutes a different project.
- You do not need to check code of projects you're not working with, unless asked to.
- You can add new dependencies in scripts, if they are the best solution.
- Don't modify readme.
- Don't run unit tests, there are no unit tests configured.
- Don't run Prettier.

Currently this is the only AGENTS.md in the repo, don't look for others.
